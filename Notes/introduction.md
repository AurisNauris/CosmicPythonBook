# Introduction

## Why do our designs go wrong?

- I would argue that the authors wrongly establish definitions of chaos (randomness) and order. Neither is complex, the state in between is a complex one because randomness can be understood easily by statistics, while order can be understood easily by a unit cell and translation vector.
- Software system is akin to a garden in that it needs to be looked after, pruned, trimmed around otherwise you will end up with a highly complex system, difficult to deal with.
- **morass** - a complicated or confusing situation
- In a chaotic system every part of code does a little bit of everything, so they start to look the same
- Without a proper separation of concerns, changing how, e.g., the software interacts with emails will be messy, because then one will have to go through all the code and this will very likely cause massive breaks
